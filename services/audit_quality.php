                    We adopted Horizon - an innovative audit approach, via the use of our audit software Voyager and supplementary software Tbeam and Pentana Checker. This enables the audit team to generate audit programs that are tailored to client specific situations and focused on the identified risk areas. This approach helps to deliver more extensive and proactive advice.
